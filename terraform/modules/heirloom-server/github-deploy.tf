# Just-in-time SSH access for the deploy workflow
#
# Port 22 is closed to everyone except `allowed_ssh_cidrs`, which lists the
# addresses people SSH from. A deploy runs on a GitHub-hosted runner whose
# address is picked at run time out of thousands, so it cannot be in that list.
# Instead the deploy workflow opens port 22 for its own /32, deploys, and
# revokes the rule again -- leaving the port shut for all but the couple of
# minutes a deploy takes.
#
# This role is the only thing that lets it do that, and it can do nothing else:
# two EC2 actions, on this one security group. The instance itself still has no
# IAM profile -- this role belongs to the workflow, not to the box.
#
# Set github_deploy_repository to create it. Feed the outputs to the repo's
# GitHub environment as AWS_DEPLOY_ROLE_ARN and DEPLOY_SECURITY_GROUP_ID; until
# both are set the workflow skips the open/close steps and relies on port 22
# already allowing the runner.
